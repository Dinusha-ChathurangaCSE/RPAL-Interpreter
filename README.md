### How to run
The following are the Instructions to run the project in a **command line:**
- Your local machine must be able to run `make` command in command line, and have java installed.
- Run `make` in the root directory
- Put your RPAL test programs in the root directory. We had added the <a href="input.txt">t1.txt</a> to the root directory, which contains the sample input program of the <a href="docs/ProgrammingProject.pdf">Project_Requirements</a> document.
- For more test programs look at the <a href="test-programs">test-programs</a> directory.
- The following are the available commands that can be used for running different RPAL programs:
  - Run `<path>\Group125>java myrpal <file>` for running the file which contains any RPAL programs and ***print only the Output***.
  - Run `<path>\Group125>java myrpal -ast <file>` for running the file and ***print AST(Abstract Syntax Tree)***.
  - Run `<path>\Group125>java myrpal -st <file>` for running the file and ***print ST(Standardized Tree) ***.

  - `-ast` and `-st` are case insetive when calling them.
- You can run it with argument pasing in any other suitable environments too.
